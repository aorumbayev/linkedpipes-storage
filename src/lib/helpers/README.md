## Support for NSS 5

The following codebase is taken from [Inrupt React Components](https://github.com/inrupt/solid-react-components#access-control-list).
The original codebase was written in JavaScript, it was converted to TypeScript for the intents of this package.
The original implementation with rdflib became obsolete and incompatible with NSS releases starting v5, therefore
in order to quickly support new syntax for ACL file management, the codebase from official inrupt repository was reused.
